<h1>Privacy Policy for FINITE: Life Perspective</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: December 2025</strong></p>

<p>
FINITE: Life Perspective (“the App”) is published on Google Play by 
<strong>GoodTimes Initiative</strong> and developed by <strong>Deniz Özcan</strong> 
(“I”, “me”, “my”). This Privacy Policy explains how user data is handled.
I am committed to transparency and protecting user privacy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
FINITE is an offline personal reflection and habit-building tool.
The App does <strong>not collect, store, transmit, or process personal data on external servers</strong>.
All user data remains locally on the user's device.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection and Local Storage</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>collect personal information</li>
  <li>store data on any external server</li>
  <li>use analytics or tracking tools</li>
  <li>access sensitive device permissions</li>
  <li>share any user data with third parties</li>
</ul>

<p>
All user-generated content (journal entries, habits, reflections, tasks) 
is stored locally on the device and fully controlled by the user.
</p>

<p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong>  
Uninstalling the App permanently deletes all locally stored data.  
I do not retain or have access to this data at any time.</p>

<h2>3. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
<p>
The App itself does not collect analytics or device data.  
However, Google Play may provide anonymous, aggregated statistics such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>install counts</li>
  <li>device categories</li>
  <li>country-level distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>
These reports contain <strong>no personally identifiable information</strong> 
and are generated solely by Google.  
For details, see Google’s privacy policy:  
<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">
https://policies.google.com/privacy
</a>
</p>

<h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
The App offers optional premium features through Google Play Billing 
(monthly subscription, yearly subscription, and lifetime unlock).
</p>

<p>
All transactions are processed by Google Play.  
I do <strong>not</strong> receive:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>payment information</li>
  <li>billing names or addresses</li>
  <li>email addresses</li>
  <li>Google account identifiers</li>
</ul>

<p>
Google Play may only notify the App of purchase status (e.g., “subscription active”), 
which is used locally to unlock features.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App does not use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>advertising SDKs</li>
  <li>analytics services</li>
  <li>cloud databases</li>
  <li>external servers</li>
</ul>

<p>
The only third-party service used is 
<strong>Google Play Billing</strong>, required for purchases.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not directed to children under 13.  
Since no data is collected, the App complies with relevant privacy protection standards.
</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<p>
Because all information remains on the user's device, 
data security is dependent on the device's operating system and user practices.
The App does not transmit data externally.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated to ensure compliance with legal or platform requirements.  
The most current version will always be available on the listed URL.
</p>
