<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<hr>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>QR Creator Pro</strong> (the “Application”) handles information.
The Application is published on the Google Play Store by <strong>GoodTimes Initiative</strong>.
</p>

<p>
We are committed to protecting user privacy. QR Creator Pro is designed as a
<strong>fully local, serverless application</strong>. We do not collect, store, process, transmit,
or have access to any personal or non-personal user data.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Publisher Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Application Name:</strong> QR Creator Pro</li>
    <li><strong>Publisher:</strong> GoodTimes Initiative</li>
    <li><strong>Developer / Data Controller:</strong> Deniz Özcan</li>
    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Google Play Store</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
<strong>QR Creator Pro does not collect any data.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>No personal data is collected</li>
    <li>No identifiers (such as name, email, IP address, or device ID) are collected</li>
    <li>No usage analytics are collected</li>
    <li>No crash reports are collected</li>
    <li>No advertising or marketing data is collected</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Application operates entirely offline and does not require user accounts,
registration, or authentication.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Data Processing and Storage</h2>
<p>
All data created or used within QR Creator Pro — including QR codes, designs,
images, logos, or exported files — is processed <strong>exclusively on the user’s device</strong>.
</p>

<p>
We do not operate servers, databases, APIs, or cloud services related to this Application.
No data ever leaves the user’s device as a result of using QR Creator Pro.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not share data with third parties.
</p>

<p>
Because no data is collected or transmitted, there is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>No data sharing with advertisers</li>
    <li>No data sharing with analytics providers</li>
    <li>No data sharing with affiliates or partners</li>
    <li>No data sharing with governmental or legal entities</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>5. Permissions</h2>
<p>
If the Application requests device permissions (such as camera or storage access),
those permissions are used <strong>solely to provide core functionality</strong> requested by the user,
for example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Camera access for scanning QR codes</li>
    <li>Storage access for saving or exporting QR images</li>
</ul>

<p>
All permission-based operations occur locally on the device.
We do not monitor, log, or access any content generated or accessed through these permissions.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. User Responsibility</h2>
<p>
Users are solely responsible for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The content they generate using QR Creator Pro</li>
    <li>The data encoded within QR codes</li>
    <li>The use, distribution, and sharing of generated QR codes</li>
</ul>

<p>
The publisher has no visibility into, control over, or responsibility for user-generated content.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
QR Creator Pro does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
Because the Application does not collect any data at all, it is inherently compliant with
children’s privacy regulations such as COPPA.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Since no data is collected, stored, or transmitted by the Application, there is no centralized
data storage to secure.
</p>

<p>
Users are responsible for securing their own devices and any files they choose to export
or share from the Application.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
No international data transfers occur, as no data is collected or transmitted.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect legal, regulatory,
or functional changes to the Application.
</p>

<p>
Any updates will be published with a revised “Last updated” date.
Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
</p>
