    <div class="meta">
        <strong>Application:</strong> Inventory Stock Manager Pro<br>
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> December, 2025
    </div>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Inventory Stock Manager Pro</strong> (the “Application”)
        handles information in connection with your use of the Application.
        The Application is published on the Google Play Store by <strong>Deniz Özcan</strong>,
        under the publisher name <strong>GoodTimes Initiative</strong>
        (the “Developer”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
    </p>

    <p>
        The Application is designed with a strict <strong>offline-first</strong> and
        <strong>local-data-only</strong> architecture.
        Your data remains entirely under your control and is never accessible to the Developer.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope of This Privacy Policy</h2>

        The Application does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, process, transmit,
        or access any personal or non-personal data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No data is sent to the Developer.</li>

        <li>No analytics, tracking, or profiling tools are implemented.</li>
        <li>No device identifiers, IP addresses, or user accounts are collected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All data created or entered by the user remains exclusively on the user’s device.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>

        retrieve, or recover this data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The Application requests certain permissions solely to enable its core features.
        All permissions are used locally and never for data transmission.
    </p>

    <h3>4.1 Camera</h3>

        when explicitly initiated by the user.

        <li>Restoring backups from user-selected files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The Application operates fully offline except for subscription-related functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>5.1 Google Play Billing</h3>
    <p>
        Internet access is required solely for subscription verification and purchase management
        via <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        All payment processing is handled entirely by Google.
        The Developer does not have access to payment details, billing information,

    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>

        as no user data is collected or accessible.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Because all data is stored locally, data security depends on the user’s device,
        operating system, and personal security practices.
        The Developer cannot be held responsible for data loss caused by device failure,
        user error, or unauthorized access to the device.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <h2>10. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        The user is solely responsible for managing their data, maintaining backups,
        and securing access to their device.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
        Any changes will be reflected within the Application or its Google Play Store listing.
        Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
